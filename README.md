# Shader_based-Rendering with GLSL
 
In this project, Implementing Shder-based rendering with GLSL, and comparing the result with OpenGL fixed PipeLine

Implementing the following functions:

a. Create two windows: one is for fixed pipeline rendering (e.g., from your first assignment) and the other one is for shader-based rendering.

b. Calculate the model-view and projection matrix (third-party libraries like glm are not allowed).

c. Write code for vertex position transformation by passing model-view and projection matrix to the vertex shader. 

d. Support translations and rotations of the virtual camera. Translations and rotations should be defined with respect to the coordinate system of the camera (CCS).

e. Render the models using points, wireframe and solid representations.

f. Reset the camera to its original position.

g. Support for changing the values of the near and far clipping planes.

h. Support for interactive change of colors (R, G, B) for the models, making sure that the color change is apparent under all rendering modes.

i. Support for reading a new model file through the user interface.
