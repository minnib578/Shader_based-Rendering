# Shader_based-Rendering with GLSL
 
In this project, Implementing Shader-based rendering with GLSL, and comparing the result with OpenGL fixed PipeLine

Implementing the following functions:

* Create two windows: one is for fixed pipeline rendering (e.g., from your first assignment) and the other one is for shader-based rendering.

* Calculate the model-view and projection matrix (third-party libraries like glm are not allowed).

* Write code for vertex position transformation by passing model-view and projection matrix to the vertex shader. 

* Support translations and rotations of the virtual camera. Translations and rotations should be defined with respect to the coordinate system of the camera (CCS).

* Render the models using points, wireframe and solid representations.

* Reset the camera to its original position.

* Support for changing the values of the near and far clipping planes.

* Support for interactive change of colors (R, G, B) for the models, making sure that the color change is apparent under all rendering modes.

* Support for reading a new model file through the user interface.
